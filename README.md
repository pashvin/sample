# sample applications and algorithm repo

This repo is a playground of many sample apps and algorithmes which I developed on my own way.
I wrote those as I understand those process and make is simple for my own understanding.
It may not be the best way to write the way I did but it shows how I understood it.
In some cases I created own problem and came up with own solution.
For example I wanted to write alogorithms in Typescript but wanted to execute it directly from console.
For that I created JS file which complies selected algorithm file and execte and print output on console.
