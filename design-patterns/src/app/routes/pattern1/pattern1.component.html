<p>pattern 1 : Adapter Pattern</p>
<p>As part of XMPP web client, I used this pattern. In Web, handling JSON is easy compare to XML. XMPP protocol is XML based so adapter converts incoming XML to JSON. </p>
<p>For Out going also we can use second adapter to covert JSON to XML but it was easy to construct XML outgoing data vs processing incoming XML so I used only one adapter</p>
