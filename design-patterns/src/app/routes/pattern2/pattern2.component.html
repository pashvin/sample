<p>pattern:2 Singleton</p>
<p>Very common pattern to hold single copy of data like configuration.</p>
<p>React redux or Angular root service use this pattern but if you want to implement your own, then it is very simple</p>
<p>Try to hide constructor and expose method which allows creating class instance only once</p>
<button (click)="run();">Run sample</button>
