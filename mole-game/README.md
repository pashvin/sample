Game solution
=============

Ref: Please see pdf file in this folder to read about problem statement.

Introduction:
=============

I am a primary Angular developer so I developed this game in Angular but also wanted to challenge my self so later replicated in React.
Please first see Angular project and then check React one.

Environment:
============

In order to run this Game you will need Node V14.18.1 or higher. I developed in Mac but it will work on Windows too.
I tested this game in Chrome browser so far. Game has diff levels.


How to run Angular project:
===========================

1. Double check you have Node 14.x in your path
2. open terminal prompt and Go to ./angular/whack
3. run "npm i" to install node_modules
4. run "npm run start"
5. open browser and go localhost:4200
6. select level of the game and click on start button to play


How to run React project:
===========================

1. Double check you have Node 14.x in your path
2. open terminal prompt and Go to ./react/whack
3. run "npm i" to install node_modules
4. run "npm run start"
5. open browser and go localhost:3000
6. select level of the game and click on start button to play (to make it little diff in react the target are vertically stacked)
